TODO: 1. Check scip data cleaning
           1.1 Add unique cols removal (all values of feature are the same)
      2. Analyze pictures => Think about using this to improve results

@Todo 1. FICO Feature Reduction
      2. SCIP Analyse
        DONE Create df with mean, median, min/max, sgm
        2.2 Compare Distribution to FICO
      3. Check scaling
        3.1 aka in what range does the scaled feature lie in the end
      4. Run Regression with new Xpress data-> wait for new data
      5. Experiment random noise:
         Instead of Rule         A          B       Do:  A          A
                    Instance     123        123          123        456
      6. Use more SCIP feature
      7. Write over Overfitting in Masterarbeit
      8. Rename Features.
        8.1 e.g.: #Presolve Global Entities to #MIP Instances
        8.3 In SCIP Avg pseudocosts are more or less bound change
      9. User threshold for using predicted rule
        9.1 aka If Model is biased towards Mixed rule, only choose mixed if predicted time gain is >= 10%(or so),
            and vice versa


Erkenntnisse SCIP FICO Xpress Comparison:
1. Avg pseudcosts and avg bound change differ by a lot
2. Avg strong branching iterations in root SCIP is just 0.0 for all instances
